Java Hangman Game

A simple console-based Hangman game built in Java where the player needs to guess the name of a fruit. The game picks a random fruit from a list stored in the words.txt file, and the player has 6 attempts to guess the correct letters. If they make 6 incorrect guesses, the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message. If the word is guessed correctly, the player wins!

How to Play

Start the game: When you run the program, a random fruit word will be selected from the words.txt file.

Guess letters: You will be prompted to enter a letter. If the letter is correct, the word will update to reveal the correctly guessed letter(s). If the letter is incorrect, you will lose an attempt.

Game Over: You have 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message and the correct word revealed.

Win: If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before you reach 6 incorrect guesses, you win!
